# Cilium Gateway API use cases

Cilium already uses Envoy for L7 policy and observability for some protocols, and this same component is used as the sidecar proxy in many popular Service Mesh implementations. So it's a natural step to extend Cilium to offer more of the features commonly associated with Service Mesh â€” though contrary to other solutions, without the need for any pod sidecars. Instead, this Envoy proxy is embedded with Cilium, which means that only one Envoy container is required per node.

The Gateway API has core support for cross Namespace routing. This is useful when more than one user or team is sharing the underlying networking infrastructure, yet control and configuration must be segmented to minimize access and fault domains. Gateways and Routes can be deployed into different Namespaces and Routes can attach to Gateways across Namespace boundaries. This allows user access control to be applied differently across Namespaces for Routes and Gateways, effectively segmenting access and control to different parts of the cluster-wide routing configuration. The ability for Routes to attach to Gateways across Namespace boundaries are governed by Route attachment. Route attachment is explored in this lab and demonstrates how independent teams can safely share the same Gateway.

Route attachment is an important concept that dictates how Routes attach to Gateways and program their routing rules. It is especially relevant when there are Routes across Namespaces that share one or more Gateways. Gateway and Route attachment is bidirectional - attachment can only succeed if the Gateway owner and Route owner both agree to the relationship. Gateways support attachment constraints which are fields on Gateway listeners that restrict which Routes can be attached. Gateways support Namespaces and Route types as attachment constraints. Any Routes that do not meet the attachment constraints are not able to attach to that Gateway. Similarly, Routes explicitly reference Gateways that they want to attach to through the Route's parentRef field. Together these create a handshake between the infra owners and application owners that enables them to independently define how applications are exposed through Gateways. This is effectively a policy that reduces administrative overhead. App owners can specify which Gateways their apps should use and infra owners can constrain the Namespaces and types of Routes that a Gateway accepts.

While HTTP is still the king of protocols in the web, gRPC is increasingly used, in particular for its low latency and high throughput capabilities.
